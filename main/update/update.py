    # prompt user for results
    # update standings
    # update excel file
    # send email
    
    #if all results are in:
        #update team who goes through
        #update excel file
        #send email
    
    
# scratch that - assume we get the results somehow
    # flashscore:
        # assume we get the link
        #first whenever we run it use similar save latestMatchCovered.json file
        # try to go through all results and update standings
        # need some way to filter away if the game is in progress
        # need some way to know total number of games (so when to stop looking for results, and check standings instead)
